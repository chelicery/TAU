# Lab 5 - Testing framework Ruby Test::Unit


## About
test-unit is a xUnit family unit testing framework for Ruby. 

Test::Unit provides a complete testing suite for your needs - supporting TDD, BDD, mocking, and benchmarking.

## Features


  - test-unit 1.2.3 is the original test-unit, taken from the Ruby distribution. It is being distributed as a gem to allow tool builders to use it as a stand-alone package. (The test framework in ruby is going to radically change very soon).

  - test-unit will be improved actively and may break compatiblity with test-unit 1.2.3. (We will not hope it if it isnâ€™t needed.)

  - Some features exist as separated gems like GUI test runner. (Tk, GTK+ and Fox) test-unit-full gem package provides for installing all test-unit related gems easily.

## Setup
1. You need to have Ruby installed. There is easy Windows Ruby installer https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/. For this toutorial I used 2.7.2-devkit. 

2. The easiest way for simple Ruby testingon Windows is running command prompt [cmd] with Ruby. It's feature attached to Ruby Devkit, installed above.
